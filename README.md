# APPLYING PHYSICS INFORMED NEURAL NETWORKS TO SWING EQUATION

This paper focuses on implementing Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) on simulating the power system dynamics. It utilizes the underlying physical laws governing the data
to reduce the computational burden and greatly decreases the simulation time. It is able to model a simple neural network structure with high accuracy to predict the dynamics of the system. They are able to accurately predict non-linear models with scarce data. Any continuous function can be modelled with a good accuracy using PINNs. In this paper, we determine the rotor angle with given parameters in single machine infinite bus system and test its computational time and accuracy in comparison to conventional methods.
